# ⚽ Football Points Prediction using Linear Regression

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict football team points based on match statistics and team identity. It includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Linear_regression_project.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `all_tables.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Encode categorical features.
3. Split data into training/testing sets.
4. Apply feature scaling.
5. Train a linear regression model.
6. Apply regularization and tune hyperparameters.
7. Evaluate the model with appropriate metrics.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the notebook `Linear_regression_project.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
